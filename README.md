# forum

I am in a group of 5 for this project. We agreed to split the group into 2 teams, because we thought we are here to learn, and there will be too little for each of us to do if we don't split.

I was in the team of 2. I was responsible for all of the database operations, the login system, the post and comments processing and displaying. And
the other groupmate was mainly responsible for the website layout, CSS, and the likes and dislikes, and the category.

After finishing the draft version of the forum, we had a meeting and the whole group has decided to continue with my team's code.
The group gave various suggestions and ways of improvements on this.
At the end, another groupmate.wrote the Docker file. 


There are 5 optionals for this project:

advanced-features

authentication

image-upload

moderation

security

And I am responsible for the security optional. (See forum-security repo)
